You can see how to run the program by looking in the Makefile.

The file "input" contains some example input. The format is fairly obvious,
but here are some caveats:

 * We aren't using a fancy parser (yet), so there is no support for comments,
 	and each directive must be entirely on its own, single line.

 * The program does almost no error checking, so you'd better give it correct
 	input.

 * All custom text (names and descriptions) must consist entirely of word
 	characters (letters, numbers, and underscores).

 * We are not responsible for you using a word which is reserved by Graphviz.

 * Asterisk means "many". No asterisk means "one".

 * An exclamation point indicates total participation.
